  <summary><b>:telescope: 2021 goal</b></summary>
  Good-bye 2020, Hello 2021 success!<br>
  I took the jump in 2020 to change my life and I have not looked back. This year's goal is to finish a lot of work!  

  1. Finish my Lambda Program.
  2. Complete at least two fully functional Apps and publish them to the App store.
  3. Land a dream job as an iOS Developer.

  <summary><b>😷 2020 goal</b></summary>
  
  Life sometimes gives us lemons🍋.<br>
  2020 was not the year we all wanted. Having to adapt to a world epidemic was not easy. This year, I chose to become an iOS Developer! Mobile development is not as easy as the commercials may have lead to you believe. I joined Lambda's iOS Development program to be part of a community of like-minded developers who can help me find my path. So far I have not looked back and the journey continues. 2021 here I come....

  <summary><b>🧑🏻‍💻 2019 goal</b></summary>
 
  Meeting life at a crossroad ⤲.<br>
  Career changes happen every day. I, like many people, had to make a difficult choice and take a leap of faith. I discovered I no longer wanted to continue with the career path I had worked hard for so many years. By the end of the year, I chose my new journey into tech.
